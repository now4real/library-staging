# Now4real Library

The easiest way to add Now4real to your site is to use the ready-made widget with its out-of-the-box configuration. You just need to add a script to all the pages of your website. We call it the magic line of code, because it transforms your site into an instant community hub!

```
<script async src="https://cdn.now4real.com/now4real.js"></script>
```

You can place this line anywhere on your page, but it’s usually inserted before the `</body>` tag at the end of the page or within the `<head>` section at the beginning of the page.

Congratulations! That’s all there is to it. As soon as you add the code to your pages, Now4real starts working, and you will see the blue Now4real widget in the bottom-left corner of your pages.
